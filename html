        <p class="p1">Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic
        period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of
        dinosaurs is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic
        extinction event 201.3 mya and their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil
        record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch,
        and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya.
        Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all
        dinosaurs other than birds.</p>

        <p class="p2">The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name "dinosaur" (meaning "terrible
        lizard") being coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1842 to refer to these "great fossil lizards".[7][8][9] Since then, mounted
        fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part
        of popular culture. The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have
        ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as the Jurassic Park franchise. Persistent public
        enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly
        covered by the media.</p>
